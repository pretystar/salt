Extras
------

A few extras to play with, including a replacement minion running Alpine Linux instead of CentOS, a state that installs NGINX and syncs web files, and a custom runner that does an HTTP hit against each minion and prints the results.

Install notes are in each file, except for the Dockerfile.alpine.minion, which you can use to replace the Dockerfile.minion in the main dir.
